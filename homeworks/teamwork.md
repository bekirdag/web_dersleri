# What is Teamwork

When you’re in an agency, you have limited resources to play with: limited time, limited money, and limited human power. No matter how great your best people are, they probably still have basic needs they need to take care of, like sleeping, eating, and watching Netflix.

These types of limitations are a challenge for any business. But that challenge is amplified for agencies: not only are you working with constantly-evolving client requirements, but you also need to think about your own company’s growth, and be able to quickly gauge whether you have the bandwidth to take on new business in a given period.

“We have a finite number of resources, and it’s enough if you plan correctly,” Jodie Robinson, Group Account Director at Velocity Partners told us. “But because of the nature of the business, you can’t be certain about what’s going to happen. We encounter issues almost daily: clients running late with feedback, a new stakeholder comes in unexpectedly, the creative teams maybe just simply need more time to do the work.”

“That automatically has a knock on effect on everything else,” she explained. “But then you still need to stick to the same timeline so there’s this constant battle between what the priorities are and how we can steal resourcing from another project without putting another one in jeopardy.”

* Your team is the most valuable resource you have. You (probably) can’t clone them, so you need to be savvy about how you allocate their time and energy.
* No matter how prepared you are, things are going to change. The project plan you made at the outset is valuable, but it’s even more valuable to be flexible, know where there’s room to move things around, and be able to think on your feet.
* Track everything — otherwise you won’t know you’re off-track (or heading for disaster!) until it’s too late.

For all these reasons, Teamwork is a very good program.

* You can create your company server and all employees can create their own accounts. 
* You can assign tasks to everyone.
* You can see working hours.
* See topics studied.
* You can see completed tasks, everything.
